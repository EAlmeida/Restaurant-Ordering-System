# Restaurant-Ordering-System
Create a skeleton, which will be a set of libraries (like a class library project). Identify ONLY the set of classes, properties, functions, interfaces. We are not looking for any UI. We are interested in your source code, your approach. Whilst this is a small problem, we expect you to submit what you believe is “production-quality” code that you would be able to run, maintain and evolve. You should submit code that you would be happy to produce in a real project, or that you would be happy to receive from a colleague. Your code will act as pointer for further technical discussion. Problem Statement: Restaurant ordering system Design the data structures and functionality of a simple program which an attendant could carry on their tablet to accept orders from various tables in a restaurant.
